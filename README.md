# datasets

Here're some datasets for machine learning experiments, including such classics as MNIST and Boston Housing.

## Usage 

Just use Git CLI to clone this repo to your working directory by running the line below:

```
git clone https://github.com/mkashirin/datasets
```

You now need to unpack all the files (they are in the `.zip` format). This can be done, using Python, by executing the following line:

```
python extractor.py
```

Now all the `.csv` files are in the csv directory.

And that is it! You're now dealing with regular `.csv` files.
